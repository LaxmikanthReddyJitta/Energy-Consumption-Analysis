## Requirements

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The following packages are required:

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis is stored in a CSV file named Global_Data_.csv. The data contains information on energy consumption across various regions over different time periods.

## Project Structure

**Data Import:** The CSV file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and the first few rows of the data are displayed.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The data is analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.

**Data Visualization:** Various plots and charts are created to visualize the data.

**Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning models are applied to predict future energy consumption based on historical data.

**Results and Conclusions:** The outcomes of the analysis and predictions are discussed.

## How to Run the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Open the Energy_Consumption_Analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.

Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Results

The project results include insights into global energy consumption trends and predictions for future energy demand. The models used for prediction have been evaluated for accuracy and reliability.
